/**
 * The {@code XAConnectionFactory} interface is a base interface for the {@code XAQueueConnectionFactory} and
 * {@code XATopicConnectionFactory} interfaces.
 *
 * <p>
 * Some application servers provide support for grouping JTA capable resource use into a distributed transaction
 * (optional). To include JMS API transactions in a JTA transaction, an application server requires a JTA aware JMS
 * provider. A JMS provider exposes its JTA support using an {@code XAConnectionFactory} object, which an application
 * server uses to create {@code XAConnection} objects.
 *
 * <p>
 * {@code XAConnectionFactory} objects are JMS administered objects, just like {@code ConnectionFactory} objects. It is
 * expected that application servers will find them using the Java Naming and Directory Interface (JNDI) API.
 *
 * <p>
 * The {@code XAConnectionFactory} interface is optional. JMS providers are not required to support this interface. This
 * interface is for use by JMS providers to support transactional environments. Client programs are strongly encouraged
 * to use the transactional support available in their environment, rather than use these XA interfaces directly.
