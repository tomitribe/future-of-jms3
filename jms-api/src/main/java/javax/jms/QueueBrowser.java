 * A client uses a {@code QueueBrowser} object to look at messages on a queue without removing them.

 * It may be an enumeration of the entire content of a queue, or it may contain only the messages matching a message

 * Messages may be arriving and expiring while the scan is done. The JMS API does not require the content of an
