/**
 * The delivery modes supported by the JMS API are {@code PERSISTENT} and {@code NON_PERSISTENT}.
 *
 * <p>
 * A client marks a message as persistent if it feels that the application will have problems if the message is lost in
 * transit. A client marks a message as non-persistent if an occasional lost message is tolerable. Clients use delivery
 * mode to tell a JMS provider how to balance message transport reliability with throughput.
 *
 * <p>
 * Delivery mode covers only the transport of the message to its destination. Retention of a message at the destination
 * until its receipt is acknowledged is not guaranteed by a {@code PERSISTENT} delivery mode. Clients should assume that
 * message retention policies are set administratively. Message retention policy governs the reliability of message
 * delivery from destination to message consumer. For example, if a client's message storage space is exhausted, some
 * messages may be dropped in accordance with a site-specific message retention policy.
 *
 * <p>
 * A message is guaranteed to be delivered once and only once by a JMS provider if the delivery mode of the message is
 * {@code PERSISTENT} and if the destination has a sufficient message retention policy.
