/**
 * The {@code Message} interface is the root interface of all JMS messages. It defines the message header and the
 * {@code acknowledge} method used for all messages.
 *
 * <p>
 * Most message-oriented middleware (MOM) products treat messages as lightweight entities that consist of a header and a
 * body. The header contains fields used for message routing and identification; the body contains the application data
 * being sent.
 *
 * <p>
 * Within this general form, the definition of a message varies significantly across products. It would be quite
 * difficult for the JMS API to support all of these message models.
 *
 * <p>
 * With this in mind, the JMS message model has the following goals:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Provide a single, unified message API
 * <li>Provide an API suitable for creating messages that match the format used by provider-native messaging
 * applications
 * <li>Support the development of heterogeneous applications that span operating systems, machine architectures, and
 * computer languages
 * <li>Support messages containing objects in the Java programming language ("Java objects")
 * <li>Support messages containing Extensible Markup Language (XML) pages
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>
 * JMS messages are composed of the following parts:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Header - All messages support the same set of header fields. Header fields contain values used by both clients
 * and providers to identify and route messages.
 * <li>Properties - Each message contains a built-in facility for supporting application-defined property values.
 * Properties provide an efficient mechanism for supporting application-defined message filtering.
 * <li>Body - The JMS API defines several types of message body, which cover the majority of messaging styles currently
 * in use.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h3>Message Bodies</h3>
 *
 * <p>
 * The JMS API defines five types of message body:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Stream - A {@code StreamMessage} object's message body contains a stream of primitive values in the Java
 * programming language ("Java primitives"). It is filled and read sequentially.
 * <li>Map - A {@code MapMessage} object's message body contains a set of name-value pairs, where names are
 * {@code String} objects, and values are Java primitives. The entries can be accessed sequentially or randomly by name.
 * The order of the entries is undefined.
 * <li>Text - A {@code TextMessage} object's message body contains a {@code java.lang.String} object. This message type
 * can be used to transport plain-text messages, and XML messages.
 * <li>Object - An {@code ObjectMessage} object's message body contains a {@code Serializable} Java object.
 * <li>Bytes - A {@code BytesMessage} object's message body contains a stream of uninterpreted bytes. This message type
 * is for literally encoding a body to match an existing message format. In many cases, it is possible to use one of the
 * other body types, which are easier to use. Although the JMS API allows the use of message properties with byte
 * messages, they are typically not used, since the inclusion of properties may affect the format.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h3>Message Headers</h3>
 *
 * <p>
 * The {@code JMSCorrelationID} header field is used for linking one message with another. It typically links a reply
 * message with its requesting message.
 *
 * <p>
 * {@code JMSCorrelationID} can hold a provider-specific message ID, an application-specific {@code String} object, or a
 * provider-native {@code byte[]} value.
 *
 * <h3>Message Properties</h3>
 *
 * <p>
 * A {@code Message} object contains a built-in facility for supporting application-defined property values. In effect,
 * this provides a mechanism for adding application-specific header fields to a message.
 *
 * <p>
 * Properties allow an application, via message selectors, to have a JMS provider select, or filter, messages on its
 * behalf using application-specific criteria.
 *
 * <p>
 * Property names must obey the rules for a message selector identifier. Property names must not be null, and must not
 * be empty strings. If a property name is set and it is either null or an empty string, an
 * {@code IllegalArgumentException} must be thrown.
 *
 * <p>
 * Property values can be {@code boolean}, {@code byte}, {@code short}, {@code int}, {@code long}, {@code float},
 * {@code double}, and {@code String}.
 *
 * <p>
 * Property values are set prior to sending a message. When a client receives a message, its properties are in read-only
 * mode. If a client attempts to set properties at this point, a {@code MessageNotWriteableException} is thrown. If
 * {@code clearProperties} is called, the properties can now be both read from and written to. Note that header fields
 * are distinct from properties. Header fields are never in read-only mode.
 *
 * <p>
 * A property value may duplicate a value in a message's body, or it may not. Although JMS does not define a policy for
 * what should or should not be made a property, application developers should note that JMS providers will likely
 * handle data in a message's body more efficiently than data in a message's properties. For best performance,
 * applications should use message properties only when they need to customize a message's header. The primary reason
 * for doing this is to support customized message selection.
 *
 * <p>
 * Message properties support the following conversion table. The marked cases must be supported. The unmarked cases
 * must throw a {@code JMSException}. The {@code String}-to-primitive conversions may throw a runtime exception if the
 * primitive's {@code valueOf} method does not accept the {@code String} as a valid representation of the primitive.
 *
 * <p>
 * A value written as the row type can be read as the column type.
 *
 * <pre>
 * |        | boolean byte short int long float double String
 * |----------------------------------------------------------
 * |boolean |    X                                       X
 * |byte    |          X     X    X   X                  X
 * |short   |                X    X   X                  X
 * |int     |                     X   X                  X
 * |long    |                         X                  X
 * |float   |                               X     X      X
 * |double  |                                     X      X
 * |String  |    X     X     X    X   X     X     X      X
 * |----------------------------------------------------------
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * In addition to the type-specific set/get methods for properties, JMS provides the {@code setObjectProperty} and
 * {@code getObjectProperty} methods. These support the same set of property types using the objectified primitive
 * values. Their purpose is to allow the decision of property type to made at execution time rather than at compile
 * time. They support the same property value conversions.
 *
 * <p>
 * The {@code setObjectProperty} method accepts values of class {@code Boolean}, {@code Byte}, {@code Short},
 * {@code Integer}, {@code Long}, {@code Float}, {@code Double}, and {@code String}. An attempt to use any other class
 * must throw a {@code JMSException}.
 *
 * <p>
 * The {@code getObjectProperty} method only returns values of class {@code Boolean}, {@code Byte}, {@code Short},
 * {@code Integer}, {@code Long}, {@code Float}, {@code Double}, and {@code String}.
 *
 * <p>
 * The order of property values is not defined. To iterate through a message's property values, use
 * {@code getPropertyNames} to retrieve a property name enumeration and then use the various property get methods to
 * retrieve their values.
 *
 * <p>
 * A message's properties are deleted by the {@code clearProperties} method. This leaves the message with an empty set
 * of properties.
 *
 * <p>
 * Getting a property value for a name which has not been set returns a null value. Only the {@code getStringProperty}
 * and {@code getObjectProperty} methods can return a null value. Attempting to read a null value as a primitive type
 * must be treated as calling the primitive's corresponding {@code valueOf(String)} conversion method with a null value.
 *
 * <p>
 * The JMS API reserves the {@code JMSX} property name prefix for JMS defined properties. The full set of these
 * properties is defined in the Java Message Service specification. The specification also defines whether support for
 * each property is mandatory or optional. New JMS defined properties may be added in later versions of the JMS API. The
 * {@code String[] ConnectionMetaData.getJMSXPropertyNames} method returns the names of the JMSX properties supported by
 * a connection.
 *
 * <p>
 * JMSX properties may be referenced in message selectors whether or not they are supported by a connection. If they are
 * not present in a message, they are treated like any other absent property. The effect of setting a message selector
 * on a property which is set by the provider on receive is undefined.
 *
 * <p>
 * JMSX properties defined in the specification as "set by provider on send" are available to both the producer and the
 * consumers of the message. JMSX properties defined in the specification as "set by provider on receive" are available
 * only to the consumers.
 *
 * <p>
 * {@code JMSXGroupID} and {@code JMSXGroupSeq} are standard properties that clients should use if they want to group
 * messages. All providers must support them. Unless specifically noted, the values and semantics of the JMSX properties
 * are undefined.
 *
 * <p>
 * The JMS API reserves the <code>JMS_<I>vendor_name</I></code> property name prefix for provider-specific properties.
 * Each provider defines its own value for <code><I>vendor_name</I></code>. This is the mechanism a JMS provider uses to
 * make its special per-message services available to a JMS client.
 *
 * <p>
 * The purpose of provider-specific properties is to provide special features needed to integrate JMS clients with
 * provider-native clients in a single JMS application. They should not be used for messaging between JMS clients.
 *
 * <h3>Provider Implementations of JMS Message Interfaces</h3>
 *
 * <p>
 * The JMS API provides a set of message interfaces that define the JMS message model. It does not provide
 * implementations of these interfaces.
 *
 * <p>
 * Each JMS provider supplies a set of message factories with its {@code Session} object for creating instances of
 * messages. This allows a provider to use message implementations tailored to its specific needs.
 *
 * <p>
 * A provider must be prepared to accept message implementations that are not its own. They may not be handled as
 * efficiently as its own implementation; however, they must be handled.
 *
 * <p>
 * Note the following exception case when a provider is handling a foreign message implementation. If the foreign
 * message implementation contains a {@code JMSReplyTo} header field that is set to a foreign destination
 * implementation, the provider is not required to handle or preserve the value of this header field.
 *
 * <h3>Message Selectors</h3>
 *
 * <p>
 * A JMS message selector allows a client to specify, by header field references and property references, the messages
 * it is interested in. Only messages whose header and property values match the selector are delivered. What it means
 * for a message not to be delivered depends on the {@code MessageConsumer} being used (see
 * {@link javax.jms.QueueReceiver QueueReceiver} and {@link javax.jms.TopicSubscriber TopicSubscriber}).
 *
 * <p>
 * Message selectors cannot reference message body values.
 *
 * <p>
 * A message selector matches a message if the selector evaluates to true when the message's header field values and
 * property values are substituted for their corresponding identifiers in the selector.
 *
 * <p>
 * A message selector is a {@code String} whose syntax is based on a subset of the SQL92 conditional expression syntax.
 * If the value of a message selector is an empty string, the value is treated as a null and indicates that there is no
 * message selector for the message consumer.
 *
 * <p>
 * The order of evaluation of a message selector is from left to right within precedence level. Parentheses can be used
 * to change this order.
 *
 * <p>
 * Predefined selector literals and operator names are shown here in uppercase; however, they are case insensitive.
 *
 * <p>
 * A selector can contain:
 *
 * <ul>
 *  <li>Literals:
 *    <ul>
 *      <li>A string literal is enclosed in single quotes, with a single quote represented by doubled single quote; for
 *          example, {@code 'literal'} and {@code 'literal''s'}. Like string literals in the Java programming language, these use
 *          the Unicode character encoding.
 *      <li>An exact numeric literal is a numeric value without a decimal point, such as {@code 57}, {@code -957}, and
 *         {@code +62}; numbers in the range of {@code long} are supported. Exact numeric literals use the integer literal
 *         syntax of the Java programming language.
 *      <li>An approximate numeric literal is a numeric value in scientific notation, such as {@code 7E3} and
 *         {@code -57.9E2}, or a numeric value with a decimal, such as {@code 7.}, {@code -95.7}, and {@code +6.2}; numbers in
 *         the range of {@code double} are supported. Approximate literals use the floating-point literal syntax of the Java
 *         programming language.
 *      <li>The boolean literals {@code TRUE} and {@code FALSE}.
 *    </ul>
 *
 *    <li>Identifiers:
 *       <ul>
 *         <li>An identifier is an unlimited-length sequence of letters and digits, the first of which must be a letter. A
 *             letter is any character for which the method {@code Character.isJavaLetter} returns true. This includes {@code '_'}
 *             and {@code '$'}. A letter or digit is any character for which the method {@code Character.isJavaLetterOrDigit}
 *             returns true.
 *         <li>Identifiers cannot be the names {@code NULL}, {@code TRUE}, and {@code FALSE}.
 *         <li>Identifiers cannot be {@code NOT}, {@code AND}, {@code OR}, {@code BETWEEN}, {@code LIKE}, {@code IN},
 *         {@code IS}, or {@code ESCAPE}.
 *         <li>Identifiers are either header field references or property references. The type of a property value in a message
 *             selector corresponds to the type used to set the property. If a property that does not exist in a message is
 *             referenced, its value is {@code NULL}.
 *         <li>The conversions that apply to the get methods for properties do not apply when a property is used in a message
 *             selector expression. For example, suppose you set a property as a string value, as in the following:
 *
 * <pre>
 * myMessage.setStringProperty("NumberOfOrders", "2");
 * </pre>
 *
 * The following expression in a message selector would evaluate to false, because a string cannot be used in an
 * arithmetic expression:
 *
 * <pre>
 * "NumberOfOrders &gt; 1"
 * </pre>
 *
 *        <li>Identifiers are case-sensitive.
 *        <li>Message header field references are restricted to {@code JMSDeliveryMode}, {@code JMSPriority},
 *            {@code JMSMessageID}, {@code JMSTimestamp}, {@code JMSCorrelationID}, and {@code JMSType}. {@code JMSMessageID},
 *            {@code JMSCorrelationID}, and {@code JMSType} values may be null and if so are treated as a {@code NULL} value.
 *        <li>Any name beginning with {@code 'JMSX'} is a JMS defined property name.
 *        <li>Any name beginning with {@code 'JMS_'} is a provider-specific property name.
 *        <li>Any name that does not begin with {@code 'JMS'} is an application-specific property name.
 *      </ul>
 *
 *      <li>White space is the same as that defined for the Java programming language: space, horizontal tab, form feed, and
 *          line terminator.
 *
 *      <li>Expressions:
 *        <ul>
 *          <li>A selector is a conditional expression; a selector that evaluates to {@code true} matches; a selector that
 *              evaluates to {@code false} or unknown does not match.
 *          <li>Arithmetic expressions are composed of themselves, arithmetic operations, identifiers (whose value is treated as
 *              a numeric literal), and numeric literals.
 *         <li>Conditional expressions are composed of themselves, comparison operations, and logical operations.
 *       </ul>
 *
 *       <li>Standard bracketing {@code ()} for ordering expression evaluation is supported.
 *       <li>Logical operators in precedence order: {@code NOT}, {@code AND}, {@code OR}
 *       <li>Comparison operators: {@code =}, {@code >}, {@code >=}, {@code <}, {@code <=}, {@code <>} (not equal)
 *         <ul>
 *          <li>Only like type values can be compared. One exception is that it is valid to compare exact numeric values and
 *              approximate numeric values; the type conversion required is defined by the rules of numeric promotion in the Java
 *              programming language. If the comparison of non-like type values is attempted, the value of the operation is false. If
 *              either of the type values evaluates to {@code NULL}, the value of the expression is unknown.
 *           <li>String and boolean comparison is restricted to {@code =} and {@code <>}. Two strings are equal if and only if
 *              they contain the same sequence of characters.
 *         </ul>
 *
 *       <li>Arithmetic operators in precedence order:
 *         <ul>
 *          <li>{@code +}, {@code -} (unary)
 *          <li>{@code *}, {@code /} (multiplication and division)
 *          <li>{@code +}, {@code -} (addition and subtraction)
 *          <li>Arithmetic operations must use numeric promotion in the Java programming language.
 *         </ul>
 *
 *       <li><code><I>arithmetic-expr1</I> [NOT] BETWEEN <I>arithmetic-expr2</I>
 *              AND <I>arithmetic-expr3</I></code> (comparison operator)
 *              <ul>
 * <li><code>"age&nbsp;BETWEEN&nbsp;15&nbsp;AND&nbsp;19"</code> is equivalent to
 * <code>"age&nbsp;&gt;=&nbsp;15&nbsp;AND&nbsp;age&nbsp;&lt;=&nbsp;19"</code>
 * <li><code>"age&nbsp;NOT&nbsp;BETWEEN&nbsp;15&nbsp;AND&nbsp;19"</code> is equivalent to
 * <code>"age&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;15&nbsp;OR&nbsp;age&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;19"</code>
 * </ul>
 * <li><code><I>identifier</I> [NOT] IN (<I>string-literal1</I>,
 *       <I>string-literal2</I>,...)</code> (comparison operator where <code><I>identifier</I></code> has a
 * <code>String</code> or <code>NULL</code> value)
 * <ul>
 * <li><code>"Country&nbsp;IN&nbsp;('&nbsp;UK',&nbsp;'US',&nbsp;'France')"</code> is true for <code>'UK'</code> and
 * false for <code>'Peru'</code>; it is equivalent to the expression
 * <code>"(Country&nbsp;=&nbsp;'&nbsp;UK')&nbsp;OR&nbsp;(Country&nbsp;=&nbsp;'&nbsp;US')&nbsp;OR&nbsp;(Country&nbsp;=&nbsp;'&nbsp;France')"</code>
 * <li><code>"Country&nbsp;NOT&nbsp;IN&nbsp;('&nbsp;UK',&nbsp;'US',&nbsp;'France')"</code> is false for
 * <code>'UK'</code> and true for <code>'Peru'</code>; it is equivalent to the expression
 * <code>"NOT&nbsp;((Country&nbsp;=&nbsp;'&nbsp;UK')&nbsp;OR&nbsp;(Country&nbsp;=&nbsp;'&nbsp;US')&nbsp;OR&nbsp;(Country&nbsp;=&nbsp;'&nbsp;France'))"</code>
 * <li>If identifier of an <code>IN</code> or <code>NOT IN</code> operation is <code>NULL</code>, the value of the
 * operation is unknown.
 * </ul>
 * <li><code><I>identifier</I> [NOT] LIKE <I>pattern-value</I> [ESCAPE
 *       <I>escape-character</I>]</code> (comparison operator, where <code><I>identifier</I></code> has a
 * <code>String</code> value; <code><I>pattern-value</I></code> is a string literal where <code>'_'</code> stands for
 * any single character; <code>'%'</code> stands for any sequence of characters, including the empty sequence; and all
 * other characters stand for themselves. The optional <code><I>escape-character</I></code> is a single-character string
 * literal whose character is used to escape the special meaning of the <code>'_'</code> and <code>'%'</code> in
 * <code><I>pattern-value</I></code>.)
 * <ul>
 * <li><code>"phone&nbsp;LIKE&nbsp;'12%3'"</code> is true for <code>'123'</code> or <code>'12993'</code> and false for
 * <code>'1234'</code>
 * <li><code>"word&nbsp;LIKE&nbsp;'l_se'"</code> is true for <code>'lose'</code> and false for <code>'loose'</code>
 * <li><code>"underscored&nbsp;LIKE&nbsp;'\_%'&nbsp;ESCAPE&nbsp;'\'"</code> is true for <code>'_foo'</code> and false
 * for <code>'bar'</code>
 * <li><code>"phone&nbsp;NOT&nbsp;LIKE&nbsp;'12%3'"</code> is false for <code>'123'</code> or <code>'12993'</code> and
 * true for <code>'1234'</code>
 * <li>If <code><I>identifier</I></code> of a <code>LIKE</code> or <code>NOT LIKE</code> operation is <code>NULL</code>,
 * the value of the operation is unknown.
 * </ul>
 * <li><code><I>identifier</I> IS NULL</code> (comparison operator that tests for a null header field value or a missing
 * property value)
 * <ul>
 * <li><code>"prop_name&nbsp;IS&nbsp;NULL"</code>
 * </ul>
 *
 *   <li><code><I>identifier</I> IS NOT NULL</code> (comparison operator that tests for the existence of a non-null header
 *       field value or a property value)
 *      <ul>
 *          <li><code>"prop_name&nbsp;IS&nbsp;NOT&nbsp;NULL"</code>
 *      </ul>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>
 * JMS providers are required to verify the syntactic correctness of a message selector at the time it is presented. A
 * method that provides a syntactically incorrect selector must result in a {@code JMSException}. JMS providers may also
 * optionally provide some semantic checking at the time the selector is presented. Not all semantic checking can be
 * performed at the time a message selector is presented, because property types are not known.
 *
 * <p>
 * The following message selector selects messages with a message type of car and color of blue and weight greater than
 * 2500 pounds:
 *
 * <pre>
 * "JMSType&nbsp;=&nbsp;'car'&nbsp;AND&nbsp;color&nbsp;=&nbsp;'blue'&nbsp;AND&nbsp;weight&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;2500"
 * </pre>
 *
 * <h3>Null Values</h3>
 *
 * <p>
 * As noted above, property values may be {@code NULL}. The evaluation of selector expressions containing {@code NULL}
 * values is defined by SQL92 {@code NULL} semantics. A brief description of these semantics is provided here.
 *
 * <p>
 * SQL treats a {@code NULL} value as unknown. Comparison or arithmetic with an unknown value always yields an unknown
 * value.
 *
 * <p>
 * The {@code IS NULL} and {@code IS NOT NULL} operators convert an unknown value into the respective {@code TRUE} and
 * {@code FALSE} values.
 *
 * <p>
 * The boolean operators use three-valued logic as defined by the following tables:
 *
 * <p>
 * <B>The definition of the {@code AND} operator</B>
 *
 * <pre>
 * | AND  |   T   |   F   |   U
 * +------+-------+-------+-------
 * |  T   |   T   |   F   |   U
 * |  F   |   F   |   F   |   F
 * |  U   |   U   |   F   |   U
 * +------+-------+-------+-------
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * <B>The definition of the {@code OR} operator</B>
 *
 * <pre>
 * | OR   |   T   |   F   |   U
 * +------+-------+-------+--------
 * |  T   |   T   |   T   |   T
 * |  F   |   T   |   F   |   U
 * |  U   |   T   |   U   |   U
 * +------+-------+-------+-------
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * <B>The definition of the {@code NOT} operator</B>
 *
 * <pre>
 * | NOT
 * +------+------
 * |  T   |   F
 * |  F   |   T
 * |  U   |   U
 * +------+-------
 * </pre>
 *
 * <h3>Special Notes</h3>
 *
 * <p>
 * When used in a message selector, the {@code JMSDeliveryMode} header field is treated as having the values
 * {@code 'PERSISTENT'} and {@code 'NON_PERSISTENT'}.
 *
 * <p>
 * Date and time values should use the standard {@code long} millisecond value. When a date or time literal is included
 * in a message selector, it should be an integer literal for a millisecond value. The standard way to produce
 * millisecond values is to use {@code java.util.Calendar}.
 *
 * <p>
 * Although SQL supports fixed decimal comparison and arithmetic, JMS message selectors do not. This is the reason for
 * restricting exact numeric literals to those without a decimal (and the addition of numerics with a decimal as an
 * alternate representation for approximate numeric values).
 *
 * <p>
 * SQL comments are not supported.
