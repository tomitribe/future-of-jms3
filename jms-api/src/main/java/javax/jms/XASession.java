/**
 * The {@code XASession} interface extends the capability of {@code Session} by adding access to a JMS provider's
 * support for the Java Transaction API (JTA) (optional). This support takes the form of a
 * {@code javax.transaction.xa.XAResource} object. The functionality of this object closely resembles that defined by
 * the standard X/Open XA Resource interface.
 *
 * <p>
 * An application server controls the transactional assignment of an {@code XASession} by obtaining its
 * {@code XAResource}. It uses the {@code XAResource} to assign the session to a transaction, prepare and commit work on
 * the transaction, and so on.
 *
 * <p>
 * An {@code XAResource} provides some fairly sophisticated facilities for interleaving work on multiple transactions,
 * recovering a list of transactions in progress, and so on. A JTA aware JMS provider must fully implement this
 * functionality. This could be done by using the services of a database that supports XA, or a JMS provider may choose
 * to implement this functionality from scratch.
 *
 * <p>
 * A client of the application server is given what it thinks is a regular JMS {@code Session}. Behind the scenes, the
 * application server controls the transaction management of the underlying {@code XASession}.
 *
 * <p>
 * The {@code XASession} interface is optional. JMS providers are not required to support this interface. This interface
 * is for use by JMS providers to support transactional environments. Client programs are strongly encouraged to use the
 * transactional support available in their environment, rather than use these XA interfaces directly.
