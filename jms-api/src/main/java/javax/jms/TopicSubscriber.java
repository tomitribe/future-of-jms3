/**
 * A client uses a {@code TopicSubscriber} object to receive messages that have been published to a topic. A
 * {@code TopicSubscriber} object is the publish/subscribe form of a message consumer. A {@code MessageConsumer} can be
 * created by using {@code Session.createConsumer}.
 *
 * <p>
 * A {@code TopicSession} allows the creation of multiple {@code TopicSubscriber} objects per topic. It will deliver
 * each message for a topic to each subscriber eligible to receive it. Each copy of the message is treated as a
 * completely separate message. Work done on one copy has no effect on the others; acknowledging one does not
 * acknowledge the others; one message may be delivered immediately, while another waits for its subscriber to process
 * messages ahead of it.
 *
 * <p>
 * Regular {@code TopicSubscriber} objects are not durable. They receive only messages that are published while they are
 * active.
 *
 * <p>
 * Messages filtered out by a subscriber's message selector will never be delivered to the subscriber. From the
 * subscriber's perspective, they do not exist.
 *
 * <p>
 * In some cases, a connection may both publish and subscribe to a topic. The subscriber {@code NoLocal} attribute
 * allows a subscriber to inhibit the delivery of messages published by its own connection.
 *
 * <p>
 * If a client needs to receive all the messages published on a topic, including the ones published while the subscriber
 * is inactive, it uses a durable {@code TopicSubscriber}. The JMS provider retains a record of this durable
 * subscription and insures that all messages from the topic's publishers are retained until they are acknowledged by
 * this durable subscriber or they have expired.
 *
 * <p>
 * Sessions with durable subscribers must always provide the same client identifier. In addition, each client must
 * specify a name that uniquely identifies (within client identifier) each durable subscription it creates. Only one
 * session at a time can have a {@code TopicSubscriber} for a particular durable subscription.
 *
 * <p>
 * A client can change an existing durable subscription by creating a durable {@code TopicSubscriber} with the same name
 * and a new topic and/or message selector. Changing a durable subscription is equivalent to unsubscribing (deleting)
 * the old one and creating a new one.
 *
 * <p>
 * The {@code unsubscribe} method is used to delete a durable subscription. The {@code unsubscribe} method can be used
 * at the {@code Session} or {@code TopicSession} level. This method deletes the state being maintained on behalf of the
 * subscriber by its provider.
 *
 * <p>
 * Creating a {@code MessageConsumer} provides the same features as creating a {@code TopicSubscriber}. To create a
 * durable subscriber, use of {@code Session.CreateDurableSubscriber} is recommended. The {@code TopicSubscriber} is
 * provided to support existing code.
