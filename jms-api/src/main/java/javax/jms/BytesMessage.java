/**
 * A {@code BytesMessage} object is used to send a message containing a stream of uninterpreted bytes. It inherits from
 * the {@code Message} interface and adds a bytes message body. The receiver of the message supplies the interpretation
 * of the bytes.
 *
 * <p>
 * The {@code BytesMessage} methods are based largely on those found in {@code java.io.DataInputStream} and
 * {@code java.io.DataOutputStream}.
 *
 * <p>
 * This message type is for client encoding of existing message formats. If possible, one of the other self-defining
 * message types should be used instead.
 *
 * <p>
 * Although the JMS API allows the use of message properties with byte messages, they are typically not used, since the
 * inclusion of properties may affect the format.
 *
 * <p>
 * The primitive types can be written explicitly using methods for each type. They may also be written generically as
 * objects. For instance, a call to {@code BytesMessage.writeInt(6)} is equivalent to
 * {@code BytesMessage.writeObject(new Integer(6))}. Both forms are provided, because the explicit form is convenient
 * for static programming, and the object form is needed when types are not known at compile time.
 *
 * <p>
 * When the message is first created, and when {@code clearBody} is called, the body of the message is in write-only
 * mode. After the first call to {@code reset} has been made, the message body is in read-only mode. When a
 * {@code BytesMessage} is sent asynchronously, the provider must call {@code reset} on the {@code BytesMessage} passed
 * to the {@code CompletionListener}. This means that the {@code CompletionListener} can read the message body without
 * needing to call {@code reset}. After a message has been sent, the client that sent it can retain and modify it
 * without affecting the message that has been sent. The same message object can be sent multiple times. When a message
 * has been received, the provider has called {@code reset} so that the message body is in read-only mode for the
 * client.
 *
 * <p>
 * If {@code clearBody} is called on a message in read-only mode, the message body is cleared and the message is in
 * write-only mode.
 *
 * <p>
 * If a client attempts to read a message in write-only mode, a {@code MessageNotReadableException} is thrown.
 *
 * <p>
 * If a client attempts to write a message in read-only mode, a {@code MessageNotWriteableException} is thrown.
