/**
 * A client uses a {@code TopicPublisher} object to publish messages on a topic. A {@code TopicPublisher} object is the
 * publish-subscribe form of a message producer.
 *
 * <p>
 * Normally, the {@code Topic} is specified when a {@code TopicPublisher} is created. In this case, an attempt to use
 * the {@code publish} methods for an unidentified {@code TopicPublisher} will throw a
 * {@code java.lang.UnsupportedOperationException}.
 *
 * <p>
 * If the {@code TopicPublisher} is created with an unidentified {@code Topic}, an attempt to use the {@code publish}
 * methods that assume that the {@code Topic} has been identified will throw a
 * {@code java.lang.UnsupportedOperationException}.
 *
 * <p>
 * During the execution of its {@code publish} method, a message must not be changed by other threads within the client.
 * If the message is modified, the result of the {@code publish} is undefined.
 *
 * <p>
 * After publishing a message, a client may retain and modify it without affecting the message that has been published.
 * The same message object may be published multiple times.
 *
 * <p>
 * The following message headers are set as part of publishing a message: {@code JMSDestination},
 * {@code JMSDeliveryMode}, {@code JMSExpiration}, {@code JMSPriority}, {@code JMSMessageID} and {@code JMSTimeStamp}.
 * When the message is published, the values of these headers are ignored. After completion of the {@code publish}, the
 * headers hold the values specified by the method publishing the message. It is possible for the {@code publish} method
 * not to set {@code JMSMessageID} and {@code JMSTimeStamp} if the setting of these headers is explicitly disabled by
 * the {@code MessageProducer.setDisableMessageID} or {@code MessageProducer.setDisableMessageTimestamp} method.
 *
 * <p>
 * Creating a {@code MessageProducer} provides the same features as creating a {@code TopicPublisher}. A
 * {@code MessageProducer} object is recommended when creating new code. The {@code TopicPublisher} is provided to
 * support existing code.
 *
 * <p>
 * Because {@code TopicPublisher} inherits from {@code MessageProducer}, it inherits the {@code send} methods that are a
 * part of the {@code MessageProducer} interface. Using the {@code send} methods will have the same effect as using the
 * {@code publish} methods: they are functionally the same.
 *
