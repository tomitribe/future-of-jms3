 * The {@code QueueRequestor} helper class simplifies making service requests.

 * The {@code QueueRequestor} constructor is given a non-transacted {@code QueueSession} and a destination
 * {@code Queue}. It creates a {@code TemporaryQueue} for the responses and provides a {@code request} method that sends
 * the request message and waits for its reply.
 *
 * <p>
 * This is a very basic request/reply abstraction which assumes the session is non-transacted with a delivery mode of
 * either AUTO_ACKNOWLEDGE or DUPS_OK_ACKNOWLEDGE. It is expected that most applications will create less basic
 * implementations.
