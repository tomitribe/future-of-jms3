/**
 * A {@code ServerSession} object is an application server object that is used by a server to associate a thread with a
 * JMS session (optional).
 *
 * <p>
 * A {@code ServerSession} implements two methods:
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@code getSession} - returns the {@code ServerSession}'s JMS session.
 * <li>{@code start} - starts the execution of the {@code ServerSession} thread and results in the execution of the JMS
 * session's {@code run} method.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>
 * A {@code ConnectionConsumer} implemented by a JMS provider uses a {@code ServerSession} to process one or more
 * messages that have arrived. It does this by getting a {@code ServerSession} from the {@code ConnectionConsumer}'s
 * {@code ServerSessionPool}; getting the {@code ServerSession}'s JMS session; loading it with the messages; and then
 * starting the {@code ServerSession}.
 *
 * <p>
 * In most cases the {@code ServerSession} will register some object it provides as the {@code ServerSession}'s thread
 * run object. The {@code ServerSession}'s {@code start} method will call the thread's {@code start} method, which will
 * start the new thread, and from it, call the {@code run} method of the {@code ServerSession}'s run object. This object
 * will do some housekeeping and then call the {@code Session}'s {@code run} method. When {@code run} returns, the
 * {@code ServerSession}'s run object can return the {@code ServerSession} to the {@code ServerSessionPool}, and the
 * cycle starts again.
 *
 * <p>
 * Note that the JMS API does not architect how the {@code ConnectionConsumer} loads the {@code Session} with messages.
 * Since both the {@code ConnectionConsumer} and {@code Session} are implemented by the same JMS provider, they can
 * accomplish the load using a private mechanism.
 *
