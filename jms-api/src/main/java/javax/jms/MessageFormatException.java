 * This exception must be thrown when a JMS client attempts to use a data type not supported by a message or attempts to

 * property values. For example, this exception must be thrown if {@code StreamMessage.writeObject} is given an
 * unsupported class or if {@code StreamMessage.readShort} is used to read a {@code boolean} value. Note that the
 * special case of a failure caused by an attempt to read improperly formatted {@code String} data as numeric values
 * must throw the {@code java.lang.NumberFormatException}.
