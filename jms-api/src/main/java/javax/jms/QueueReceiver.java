/**
 * A client uses a {@code QueueReceiver} object to receive messages that have been delivered to a queue.
 *
 * <p>
 * Although it is possible to have multiple {@code QueueReceiver}s for the same queue, the JMS API does not define how
 * messages are distributed between the {@code QueueReceiver}s.
 *
 * <p>
 * If a {@code QueueReceiver} specifies a message selector, the messages that are not selected remain on the queue. By
 * definition, a message selector allows a {@code QueueReceiver} to skip messages. This means that when the skipped
 * messages are eventually read, the total ordering of the reads does not retain the partial order defined by each
 * message producer. Only {@code QueueReceiver}s without a message selector will read messages in message producer
 * order.
 *
 * <p>
 * Creating a {@code MessageConsumer} provides the same features as creating a {@code QueueReceiver}. A
 * {@code MessageConsumer} object is recommended for creating new code. The {@code QueueReceiver} is provided to support
 * existing code.
