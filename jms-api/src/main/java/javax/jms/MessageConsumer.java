/**
 * A client uses a {@code MessageConsumer} object to receive messages from a destination. A {@code MessageConsumer}
 * object is created by passing a {@code Destination} object to a message-consumer creation method supplied by a
 * session.
 *
 * <p>
 * {@code MessageConsumer} is the parent interface for all message consumers.
 *
 * <p>
 * A {@code MessageConsumer} can be created with a message selector. A message selector allows the client to restrict
 * the messages delivered to the message consumer to those that match the selector.
 *
 * <p>
 * A client may either synchronously receive a {@code MessageConsumer}'s messages or have the {@code MessageConsumer}
 * asynchronously deliver them as they arrive.
 *
 * <p>
 * For synchronous receipt, a client can request the next message from a {@code MessageConsumer} using one of its
 * {@code receive} methods. There are several variations of {@code receive} that allow a client to poll or wait for the
 * next message.
 *
 * <p>
 * For asynchronous delivery, a client can register a {@code MessageListener} object with a {@code MessageConsumer}. As
 * messages arrive at the {@code MessageConsumer}, it delivers them by calling the {@code MessageListener}'s
 * {@code onMessage} method.
 *
 * <p>
 * It is a client programming error for a {@code MessageListener} to throw an exception.
